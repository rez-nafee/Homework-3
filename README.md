You have recently been hired by Wolfy Tech, an up and coming software company based out of Stony Brook, NY. Wolfy Techs' main goal is to make the world a better place by using cutting edge technology in everything from refrigerators to notepads. You have been hired as a Junior Software Developer to help design their newest line of calculators. You may be thinking this will just be some ordinary calculator, but you quickly realize at the first production meeting that Wolfy Tech only makes the highest quality of products, and your calculator will be much more advanced than originally thought. Not only will the calculator have to calculate numbers, but it will also need to show these calculations in pre-fix / post-fix notation and show the answer in binary and hexadecimal, in addition to some other proprietary features. After some research and preliminary write-ups and brainstorming, you realize that the best way to go about this will be to create your own Stack class.
